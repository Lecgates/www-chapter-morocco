## Upcoming Event December 2020 - Security issues in Blockchain and crypto currency

The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just nancial transactions but virtually everything of value. Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. 

Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain. 

Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. This way of using the network has many benets. 

The blockchain database isn't stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public and easily veriable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.
