## Sponsorship Opportunities with our Chapter ##

The Morocco OWASP Chapter can offer your company several sponsorship opportunities. If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these opportunities, please contact Azzeddine RAMRAMI (azzeddine[dot]ramrami[at]owasp.org), the OWASP Morocco Chapter Leader. 

### Morocco Cyber Security Day ### 

The Morocco OWASP Chapter organizes a quarterly Morocco Cyber Security Day event along with selected school and companies. This event has historically drawn around 100 of Morocco's security professionals and expert for networking and more. Your sponsorship of this event includes appetizers and drinks for the attendees.  Feel free to pass out business cards and network just like you would anywhere else. You'll find no better opportunity to get your name in front of 100+ security professionals for a free access.

### AppSec Morocco & Africa Security Conference (AppSec Africa) Sponsorship ### 

The AppSec Morocco & Africa is an OWASP conference held annually in Morocco. It is a gathering of 250+ web app developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information security professionals. ApPSec is held in Morocco Casablanca or Rabar, where more Fortune 100 companies call home than any other state and it is held in Morocco which is a hub for startups in Morocco. At AppSec Morocco & Africa, leaders at these companies along with security architects and developers gather to share cutting-edge ideas, initiatives, and technology advancements.

Being a non-profit organization, we rely mostly on sponsorships to help us provide the funding to make AppSec Morocco & Africa successful.

### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship ### 

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Austin area has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting.
